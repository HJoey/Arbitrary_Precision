# Arbitrary_Precision
This is the lab#A from the course Application Acceleration with High-Level-Synthesis and the design files are offered by the course.

Two different designs are in this repo:
1. Using floating-point type (under the folder `fixed-point_type`) 
2. Using arbitrary precision fixed type (under the folder `arbitrary_precision_fixed_type`).

The two designs are separated in two projects both of them are named `window_fn_prj` following UG871.

The source codes are placed under the folder `window_fn_prj`.
